<p>Rolodex's are the a way to store and manage data. While in the past it was known for managing contacts. The cylander alowed the user to scroll through the index cards filled with various contacts and information. To us,we want the user to easily locate and and find contacts, much in the way a rolodex allows the user to manage there information. A great thing about a roledex is that the blank cars in the deck, allow the user a blank canvas, where they can customize how they can save and format the infomation. It is a great way  for the user to put as much or as little information as they need for a designated card. One ispiration, that is actually an issue of the roledex, is the filtering system. The Rolodex is a physical object, so however the information is input into the structure, is how it will stay. It is up to the user to organize it however they want, but there isn't as much flexibility once the card is in place.
