<p>Rolodex's are a way to store and manage data. While in the past it was known for managing contacts. The cylinder allowed the user to scroll through the index cards filled with various contacts and information. To us, we want the user to easily locate and find contacts; much in the way a rolodex allows the user to store their information in a central location. A great thing about a rolodex is that the blank cards in the deck give the user a blank canvas. The user can customize how they can save and format the information. It is a great way for the user to put as much or as little information as they need for a designated card. One inspiration, that is actually an issue of the rolodex, is the filtering system. The Rolodex is a physical object, so however the information is input into the structure, is how it will stay. All the information is in one location. It is up to the user to organize it however they want, but there isn't as much flexibility once the card is in place. Plus the user has to physically access the rolodex, no cloud based systems here.

<p>With the advent of Siri, Cortana and other voice based system, more and more industries have started to use this interface. Most of the time, voice based system are used for processing tasks that needs to be performed repeatedly, such as customer service for bank, online shopping and etc. This would be a great fit for dining hall staff as they are follow the same routine of meal preperation everyday. Also, the system could be easier for users as they don't need to learn any software, instead, they can just follow the instruction of the software. Last but not least, the interface has a potential of giving user suggestion for meal planning by calculating on the backend based on amount of ingredient, time and etc. Staff would no longer need to do the painstaking planning themselves.
