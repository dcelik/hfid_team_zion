<h2>Inspiration Design</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Rainbow:Rainbow puts multiple objects together in a harmonically and aethetically pleasing way. It presents a way to mangage multiple tasks in a elegant form.</li>
  <li>Books:Book is an easy form to convey to users the information the author intended to address. Especially in kitchen book can be the most common form for recipe and other administration documents.</li>
  <li>Newspapers:Newspaper presents lots of information on a single paper. We can learn from it how to use convey more info to users on a simple form.</li>
  <li>Flowers:A bouquet consists of a number of colorful flowers of various kinds, yet it remains organized. We can make an analogy when designing the look of our interface.</li>
  <li>Rolodex:Rolodex gives the user the opportunity to choose the information he/she needs form the stack of information presented to them. It can be the form for dining hall staff to pick ingredients available in a short time. </li>
  <li>Walkman:Walkman uses music/sound to convey to user information with requring them to read or touch the product. It inspires us a new interaction for the interface.</li>
  <li>Boombox:Simmilarly to walkman, boombox uses the same for of interaction. It's portable and it exterts a larger impact to however many users in the vicinity of the product.</li>
  <li>Punch Cards:Punch cards conveys a large amount of information on a small paper. It can be used to store a colletion of information (such as recipes) without taking much space.</li>
  <li>Siri:With the advent of Siri, Cortana and other voice based system, more and more industries have started to use this interface. Most of the time, voice based system are used for processing tasks that needs to be performed repeatedly, such as customer service for bank, online shopping and etc. This would be a great fit for dining hall staff as they are follow the same routine of meal preperation everyday. Also, the system could be easier for users as they don't need to learn any software, instead, they can just follow the instruction of the software. Last but not least, the interface has a potential of giving user suggestion for meal planning by calculating on the backend based on amount of ingredient, time and etc. Staff would no longer need to do the painstaking planning themselves.</li>
</ul>
