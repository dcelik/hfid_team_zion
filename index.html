<p>Grubhub marks the first true online delivery/takeout ordering method not asscoiated with individual businesses. The company was founded on the ideal of reducing the usage of paper menus and evolved into the ordering behemoth it is now. Grubhub consolidates a huge amount of restaurant data into a pleasing interface that summarizes each of the meals and provides space for showing of the users cart while they can continue shopping. The system provides an example of how to create a food interface that combines selection with pricing, tax, and shipping calculation. In our case this would be more akin to calculating the desired quantities of ingredients for their planned meals and in perhaps calculating the price of ordering this food from different vendors. For us, Grubhub represents an already existing product whose interface contains many of the functionalities we will require for our own application. In addition to the computer interface, Grubhub also has an app whose design we can leverage to improve our own interactions with users.

<p>Rolodex's are a way to store and manage data. While in the past it was known for managing contacts. The cylinder allowed the user to scroll through the index cards filled with various contacts and information. To us, we want the user to easily locate and find contacts; much in the way a rolodex allows the user to store their information in a central location. A great thing about a rolodex is that the blank cards in the deck give the user a blank canvas. The user can customize how they can save and format the information. It is a great way for the user to put as much or as little information as they need for a designated card. One inspiration, that is actually an issue of the rolodex, is the filtering system. The Rolodex is a physical object, so however the information is input into the structure, is how it will stay. All the information is in one location. It is up to the user to organize it however they want, but there isn't as much flexibility once the card is in place. Plus the user has to physically access the rolodex, no cloud based systems here.

<p>With the advent of Siri, Cortana and other voice based system, more and more industries have started to use this interface. Most of the time, voice based system are used for processing tasks that needs to be performed repeatedly, such as customer service for bank, online shopping and etc. This would be a great fit for dining hall staff as they are follow the same routine of meal preperation everyday. Also, the system could be easier for users as they don't need to learn any software, instead, they can just follow the instruction of the software. Last but not least, the interface has a potential of giving user suggestion for meal planning by calculating on the backend based on amount of ingredient, time and etc. Staff would no longer need to do the painstaking planning themselves.

<h2>Inspiration Design</h2>
<h3>Abstraction</h3>>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Rainbow:Rainbow puts multiple objects together in a harmonically and aethetically pleasing way. It presents a way to mangage multiple tasks in a elegant form.</li>
  <li>Books:Book is an easy form to convey to users the information the author intended to address. Especially in kitchen book can be the most common form for recipe and other administration documents.</li>
  <li>Newspapers:Newspaper presents lots of information on a single paper. We can learn from it how to use convey more info to users on a simple form.</li>
  <li>Flowers:A bouquet consists of a number of colorful flowers of various kinds, yet it remains organized. We can make an analogy when designing the look of our interface.</li>
  <li>Rolodex:Rolodex gives the user the opportunity to choose the information he/she needs form the stack of information presented to them. It can be the form for dining hall staff to pick ingredients available in a short time. </li>
  <li>Walkman:Walkman uses music/sound to convey to user information with requring them to read or touch the product. It inspires us a new interaction for the interface.</li>
  <li>Boombox:Simmilarly to walkman, boombox uses the same for of interaction. It's portable and it exterts a larger impact to however many users in the vicinity of the product.</li>
  <li>Punch Cards:Punch cards conveys a large amount of information on a small paper. It can be used to store a colletion of information (such as recipes) without taking much space.</li>
  <li>File Cabinet: File cabinets inspire us to make sure that the information we provide to users is organized in a hierarchial structure that is both intuitive and compact. The ability to search and store data can help small-college catering staff managers better plan inventory and meals</li>
  <li>Sears Catalog: The sears catalog provides an important view into marketing our interface against possible competitors. Even though it is mainly a print catalog, the ideas for how to get users to buy your product will help us find users to get feedback from.</li>
  <li>Towers/Pyramids: The structure of pyramids and towers is what inspires us mainly. The idea of having to create a strong foundation to maintain and support the more complex interactions works to remind us to make sure our user research is sound before proceeding.</li>
  <li>Text-to Speech: The idea of being able to seamlessly integrate multiple senses into our interface provides inspiration for utilizing more than just our sight to manage workforces.</li>
  <li>Birds: Birds represent many different ideas. Our insipriation in this case is the use of carrier pigeons as a metaphor for using older technologies to leverage thier strengths instead of trying to use only the most cutting edge ways of interacting.</li>
  <li>Bees: Bees inspire us because of their ordered productivity. In a hive, every bee has a role; some make food, some take care of the young, and some sting humans and die. They are able to perform all of these actions without the verbal/written directions that humans are used to, and they are arguably more productive because of it.</li>
  <li>Beavers: Beavers inspire us to pull resources from multiple locations and work hard to build up our complex ideas into interfaces.</li>
  <li>Seven Wonders of the World: The seven wonders inspire to create beautiful and useufl designs that can last the test of time, in our case, this time is making an interface that will be kept around after this class is over.</li>
  <li>States (South Dakota): The states of the US provide a macro-lens through which to view the catering management problem. In particular, south dakota with its varied and unique production working in tandem provides inspiration for our own designs. </li>
  <li>Dolphins: Dolphins, much like humans, are more effective when working in groups. Nature provides inspiration in many unique ways an this example of combining work to increase efficieny is exteremely applicable to our focus.</li>
