          <br>
          <h3>Grubhub</h3>
          <b>Deniz Celik</b>
          <p>Grubhub marks the first true online delivery/takeout ordering method not asscoiated with individual businesses. The company was founded on the ideal of reducing the usage of paper menus and evolved into the ordering behemoth it is now. Grubhub consolidates a huge amount of restaurant data into a pleasing interface that summarizes each of the meals and provides space for showing of the users cart while they can continue shopping. The system provides an example of how to create a food interface that combines selection with pricing, tax, and shipping calculation. In our case this would be more akin to calculating the desired quantities of ingredients for their planned meals and in perhaps calculating the price of ordering this food from different vendors. For us, Grubhub represents an already existing product whose interface contains many of the functionalities we will require for our own application. In addition to the computer interface, Grubhub also has an app whose design we can leverage to improve our own interactions with users.</p>

          <br>
          <h3>Food Management Games</h3>
          <b>Hannah Twigg-Smith</b>
          <p>Although these games represent a very simplified version of the entire food preparation/catering process, they do get some things right that we want to embody in our design. For example: one of the main difficulties of a food management game is providing the correct food to each customer in the shortest amount of time. The character being played may change (e.g. a chef, manager, or waiter/waitress), but this goal always remains the same. Many of the games also incorporate money management, employee management, and physical location management, at which point the game's interface often begins to become overwhelming and the game difficulty increases exponentially, (especially with the added time crunch). However, it does drive home the point that being prepared for each meal rush greatly decreases the stress of actually preparing the meals, which is one idea that we aim to incorporate in our design.</p>
          <p><img src="img/RestManGame.jpg"width="600" height="350"></p>
          <hr>

          <br>
          <h3>Rolodexes</h3>
          <b>Hannah Wilk</b>
          <p>Rolodexes are a way to store and manage data. While in the past it was known for managing contacts. The cylinder allowed the user to scroll through the index cards filled with various contacts and information. To us, we want the user to easily locate and find contacts; much in the way a rolodex allows the user to store their information in a central location. A great thing about a rolodex is that the blank cards in the deck give the user a blank canvas. The user can customize how they can save and format the information. It is a great way for the user to put as much or as little information as they need for a designated card. One inspiration, that is actually an issue of the rolodex, is the filtering system. The Rolodex is a physical object, so however the information is input into the structure, is how it will stay. All the information is in one location. It is up to the user to organize it however they want, but there isn't as much flexibility once the card is in place. Plus the user has to physically access the rolodex, no cloud based systems here.</p>

          <br>
          <h3>Siri</h3>
          <b>Jason Lan</b>
          <p>With the advent of Siri, Cortana and other voice based system, more and more industries have started to use this interface. Most of the time, voice based system are used for processing tasks that needs to be performed repeatedly, such as customer service for bank, online shopping and etc. This would be a great fit for dining hall staff as they are follow the same routine of meal preperation everyday. Also, the system could be easier for users as they don't need to learn any software, instead, they can just follow the instruction of the software. Last but not least, the interface has a potential of giving user suggestion for meal planning by calculating on the backend based on amount of ingredient, time and etc. Staff would no longer need to do the painstaking planning themselves.</p>
